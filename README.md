what was learned:

17/02/2025 installation and some errors that faced me during the process and i learned how to fix them. learned directory structer, I saw all the directories and the fiels inside them while locating the ones i will be using from now on; learned migrations and their possibilities, such as how the migrations work , and the migration at the end is just a version control of the database , almost like a list of SQL commands that are compatible with the database selected (used a,d runned). as well as learned that you can see what the sql script would be like without running using "php artisan migrate:rollback --pretend ", you can also undo one or more steps you did using "php artisan migrate:rollback --step='number of steps'", and there is also "migrate:reset" that does exactly what it says , as well as more migration commands; learned that there are the beginner steps that guide me as a beginner to start , and the steps are:prepping the database, Routing, building layouts and views, adding tasks , deleting tastks. and they're all detailed in their website. so i followed them to guide me to where i learned about migrations
