17/02/2025 
installation and some errors that faced me during the process and i learned how to fix them. learned directory structer, I saw all the directories and the fiels inside them while locating the ones i will be using from now on; learned migrations and their possibilities, such as how the migrations work , and the migration at the end is just a version control of the database , almost like a list of SQL commands that are compatible with the database selected (used a,d runned). as well as learned that you can see what the sql script would be like without running using "php artisan migrate:rollback --pretend ", you can also undo one or more steps you did using "php artisan migrate:rollback --step='number of steps'", and there is also "migrate:reset" that does exactly what it says , as well as more migration commands; learned that there are the beginner steps that guide me as a beginner to start , and the steps are:prepping the database, Routing, building layouts and views, adding tasks , deleting tastks. and they're all detailed in their website. so i followed them to guide me to where i learned about migrations

firstly i learned how to use laravel 8 even tho &
I leaened and practiced creating tables and altering them and some none written rules such as you need to migrate tables that are needed or depended on by other tables, as well as the connection with postgres SQL.
i also learned how to create and created controllers and models.
and I also learned about seeders and factories, and how they are used to quickly insert data into the database and the difference  between them is that the factory is mainly used for testing and it genrates numbered random data to insert in the database, and it can work with seeders that can be used to insert a single data unit a one user or role for example, i might not have had completely learned using them but i am almost there


19/02/2025
learned one to one and many to many and one to many Eloquent Database Relations , fixed all factory and seeders problems and missunderstandings , now i can use them properly without any issues, 
also learned how to comunicate and manipulate the database using create, save and other methods, as well as how are attributes defined using fillable or relation methods
